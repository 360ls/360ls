title: Project Introduction
---

The goal of this project was to create software that takes in videos of a scene from multiple cameras
and creates a single 360-degree panoramic video in realtime. The videos are to be live-streamed to a web
platform and local desktop application that can be used to monitor and manage the live feeds of police officers when they are in the field. 

By the end of the semester, we were able to complete streaming of single videos in realtime, as well as DVR playback in a web app and an electron application. We were also able to stitch two camera feeds together effectively.
