        <h1>User Stories</h1>
    </header>

    <p>This portion of the website highlights the user stories acquired for the requirements sprint. The user stories are broken down by the personas we defined for our project <a href="personas">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="police-officer">Police Officer</h2>
<ol>
  <li>As a patrolling police officer, I can view a live-stream video of on-car video from an in-car touch-screen on the streaming device so I can tell what is going on around me.</li>
  <li>As a patrolling police officer, I can tell whether or not my on-box live-stream video is being recorded or not so I have confirmation that my stream is being recorded when I am on a call.</li>
  <li>As a patrolling police officer, I can flag an interaction for later viewing by the police chief and easy access in the web platform offering so that I can look back at my day and immediately know what the most important recordings are to look back over.</li>
  <li>As a patrolling police officer, I can view all videos in a web DVR offering for incidents with which I was involved so that I can act accordingly post-interaction.</li>
  <li>As a patrolling officer, I can filter videos in the wep app to easily get to the videos that are most pertinent in the moment.</li>
  <li>As a patrolling officer, I can flag videos as active to make sure they are not deleted/archived after the 12 month video transition deadline.</li>
  <li>As a patrolling officer, in the DVR player, I can manipulate video quality to get a better stream on a poor connection, and I can zoom in on different areas of the video so I can get more information about interactions (e.g. license plate numbers).</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="police-chief">Police Chief</h2>
<ol>
  <li>As a police chief, I can view all videos in a web DVR offering for all incidents in my domain (i.e. from all officer feeds) so that I can evaluate the performance of each officer in my group.</li>
  <li>As a police chief, I can view and filter all live streams and recorded videos from all officers so I can look at old recordings as well as observe and impact live interactions by my team in the field.</li>
  <li>As a police chief, I can look at the videos flagged by all of my officers during the day and tell what interactions the officers thought were most important coming out of the day.</li>
  <li>As a police chief, I can manipulate video quality, pan around footage, pause, rewind, etc. to get a better look at individual recordings.</li>
</ol>
