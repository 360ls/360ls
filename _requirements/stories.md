## User Stories
1. I am a district attorney and I deal with a lot of cases with video evidence from the field captured by the police. I want a simple web interface that allows me to search for a particular video recorded at a certain time and view it on demand. I need to be able to save certain sections of a video so that I can go back to it and present the evidence in a trial.
2. As a patrolling police officer, I can view a live-stream video of on-car video from an in-car touch-screen on the streaming device. 
3. As a patrolling police officer, I can view all video in a web DVR offering for incidents with which I was involved.
4. As a patrolling officer, I can search for videos by time-of-incident, and tags that I set up to correspond to time-of-incident. 
5. As a patrolling officer, in the DVR player, I can manipulate video quality to get a better stream on a poor connection, and I can zoom in on different areas of the video.
6. One of Scott’s officers has just returned from an incident and Scott is performing an evaluation on his performance, so he navigates to the 360LS web interface to view the video of the interaction. He logs in using his police chief credentials and searches for the video from his officer’s car. Scott examines the video by panning around the screen and at some points pausing and rewinding the video to get a better look at the scene. He takes some notes to share with his officer and exits the system.
