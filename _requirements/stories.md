## User Stories
1. I am a district attorney and I deal with a lot of cases with video evidence from the field captured by the police. I want a simple web interface that allows me to search for a particular video recorded at a certain time and view it on demand. I need to be able to save certain sections of a video so that I can go back to it and present the evidence in a trial.
2. As a patrolling police officer, I can view a live-stream video of on-car video from an in-car touch-screen on the streaming device. 
3. As a patrolling police officer, I can view all video in a web DVR offering for incidents with which I was involved.
4. As a patrolling officer, I can search for videos by time-of-incident, and tags that I set up to correspond to time-of-incident. 
5. As a patrolling officer, in the DVR player, I can manipulate video quality to get a better stream on a poor connection, and I can zoom in on different areas of the video.
