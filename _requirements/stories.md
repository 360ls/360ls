title: User Stories

This portion of the website highlights the user stories acquired for the requirements sprint. The user stories are broken down by the personas we defined for our project [here](personas).

## Police Officer
1. As a patrolling police officer, I can view a live-stream video of on-car video from an in-car touch-screen on the streaming device.
2. As a patrolling police officer, I can view all video in a web DVR offering for incidents with which I was involved.
3. As a patrolling officer, I can search for videos by time-of-incident, and tags that I set up to correspond to time-of-incident. 
4. As a patrolling officer, in the DVR player, I can manipulate video quality to get a better stream on a poor connection, and I can zoom in on different areas of the video.

## Police Chief
1. As a police chief
5. I am a police chief and one of my officers has just returned from an incident and I am performing an evaluation on his performance, so I navigate to the 360LS web interface to view the video of the interaction. I log in using my police chief credentials and searches for the video from my officerâ€™s car. I examine the video by panning around the screen and at some points pausing and rewinding the video to get a better look at the scene. I takes some notes to share with his officer and exits the system.
