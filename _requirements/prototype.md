Our prototype can be found at the following link.

[Prototype](http://vcms.herokuapp.com/)

The prototype consists of a full-stack python Django environment hosted in a Heroku instance. For the prototype, we hooked into our [main project inventory](https://github.com/ASK-MEdia/360ls-vcms) and tied in a CircleCI build driver that builds dynamically from updates to the master branch of our GitHub profile. The prototype dependencies are packaged in a custom vagrant build for consistent development and testing on our local devices.
