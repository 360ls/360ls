## Police Officer
Sandra is a 28 year old police officer. She joined the police force to make a difference, but she finds herself battling with today's public distrust of police officers and feeling like her every move is being questioned. She wants a better system that will both show that she is handling her day-to-day in a proper manner and increase her sense of security on-the-job. Relatively technical, she feels comfortable with touch-screen technologies, streaming video, using standard web browsers, and interacting with mobile devices. 

## Police Chief

## District Attorney
John is a 35 year old district attorney. He is passionate about his work and is open to adopting new technology that could assist in the cases that he works on. He wants a simple interface that he can use to gather and present video evidence captured by the police officers. He is proficient in basic technology, but does not want to have to go through a steep learning curve as he has very little time to invest in learning something new.
