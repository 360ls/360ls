## Police Officer

## Police Chief

## District Attorney
John is a 35 year old district attorney. He is passionate about his work and is open to adopting new technology that could assist in the cases that he works on. He wants a simple interface that he can use to gather and present video evidence captured by the police officers. He is proficient in basic technology, but does not want to have to go through a steep learning curve as he has very little time to invest in learning something new.
