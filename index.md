360 Life Stream provides a live, real-time 360 degree panoramic video of a scene where action is taking place from a traffic stop by a police officer to an IED team on a battlefield in a way that does not obstruct the view, movement or profile of the person or vehicle. The videos from multiple cameras embedded within the body of the vehicle or officerâ€™s vest are stitched, encoded, encrypted and streamed in real-time to a remote control center or a mobile device in the field via satellite data, 4G data or WIFI protocols. The 360 degree video is managed and maintained for on-demand playback at a later time using a software-as-a-service (SaaS) management model.
